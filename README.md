# PunPunMacs

(the only thing punpun related about this config is the dashboards's picture but wanted to give a fancy name)

My own Emacs config!

I'll be very grateful if someone more knowledgeable about emacs/emacs lisp made a commit cleaning or optimizing my config or suggesting some changes to
make the experience better.

Feel free to fork or do whatever you want :)
